It wasn‚Äôt until I reached out to Zara myself that they said they would resend the order. Now it‚Äôs been almost a month, and despite calling multiple times, they said they are processing the refund due to their mistake and telling me to wait 24 to 48 hours, but never received a refund . I will never order again from a company that fails to issue refunds and takes people‚Äôs money like this.",
