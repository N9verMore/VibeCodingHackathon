    "description": "Liven is your self-discovery companion, a system of tools designed to help you better understand and transform yourself. \n\nWHO’S LIVEN FOR?  \n• For you, me, anyone trying to survive in this hyperstimulated world.    \n• For those under pressure, living to meet others’ expectations, or struggling to say ‘no’.  \n• For those wanting to build a positive self-image, improve focus, or manage time.  \n• For anyone ready to liven up!\n\nAre you ready to take your inner dialogue out of your head and gain a new perspective on life? Because if you are, we’ve got tools to help you observe your experiences and reframe your days. Sounds good?\n\n  \n\nCHECK OUT OUR APPROACH:\n\n• Personalized program\n\nSet a clear, achievable goal—whether it's improving your self-image, saying \"no,\" or challenging negative thoughts. Choose your direction, and we'll help you get there with evidence-based techniques and tools. \n\n• Mood tracker\n\nPause during the day to check in with your emotions. See how you're doing—Good, Bad, Amazing! Use our emotional menu to name your feelings, notice what triggered them, and track changes over time with the Mood Calendar.\n\n• Routine builder\n\nCheck out our Tasks tool to plan new activities and get ideas for things to try each day. By adding new tasks and routines to your days, you can change your behaviour and transform.   \n\n• AI companion\n\nEver wish someone would listen to you rant without judgment, even at 3 a.m.? Meet Livie, our AI companion. If you're tired of the inner dialogue or need a fresh perspective on life, just talk to her. She'll help you break down your situations and suggest new ideas to try.  \n\n• Bite-size knowledge\n\nScientists have studied the human mind for over 100 years, uncovering how our emotions, thoughts, and actions connect to unconscious \"auto-pilot\" behaviors. We've distilled this knowledge into bite-sized insights for you to apply in your decision-making.     \n\n• Well-being tests\n\nEveryone loves quizzes! Take a break and answer a set of questions to define experiences you’re going through. Check back every week to track the changes in emotional and behavioural dynamics.        \n\n• Deep focus soundscapes\n\nWhen you don’t feel like listening to music but still want to wear headphones and block out the world, try our soundscapes.\n\n———————\n\nWHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING ABOUT US\n\n\"Positive thoughts and a calmer attitude come after 10 minutes of use.\"\n\n\"Great app to use as a guide at the start of your day.\"\n\n\"Liven is helping me turn healthy activities into habits.\"\n\n———————\nSUBSCRIPTION AND TERMS\nAfter you decide to begin your growth with Liven and download the app, you can unlock all features by subscribing to the premium subscription.\nIf you choose to purchase a premium subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
