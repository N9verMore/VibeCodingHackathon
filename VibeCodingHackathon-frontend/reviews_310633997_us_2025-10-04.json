My account has been repeatedly blocked despite not engaging in any activity that violates WhatsApp’s policies.\n\nOver the past few days, my account was blocked multiple times, and each time I submitted a review, it was restored temporarily, only to be blocked again without any clear explanation. I am confident that I am not engaging in any spammy or policy-violating behavior.\n\nI kindly request a thorough review of my account activity. I rely on WhatsApp for business communication and personal connections, and I am committed to complying with all policies.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any additional information I can provide to resolve this issue promptly.\n\nThank you for your attention and assistance.",

Also there is no way to sign in Google on IPhone either to restore WhatsApp backup from Google that was created from Android. similar isssue exists when you want to move from iPhone backup to Android WhatsApp. There is an app Move to iOS on Android but that works only on Factory Reset and then you cannot recover iPhone from iCloud.

      "content": "I cant still believe this app is as buggy as it is on iOS 17.7. App gets freezed when trying to view/download photos from groups, something that I have never ever seen happening in neither Android or Windows Phone.\n\nMaybe reduce the tracking and keep things simple, Meta :), otherwise might as well just cut communication through this platform like I did with FB on 2020\n\nSept 2025 update: on top of those bugs, AI is now forced upon us with no disable option :)",
